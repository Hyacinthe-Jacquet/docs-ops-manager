This topic introduces Tanzu <%= vars.ops_manager %> (previously Pivotal <%= vars.ops_manager %> or PCF <%= vars.ops_manager %>) and describes how to get started.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

A <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment includes both your chosen runtime and the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard. The <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard is the dashboard for administering the runtimes and services within your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

The BOSH Director, deployed as part of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation, controls VM creation and deployment,
as well as other software and service lifecycle events. <%= vars.ops_manager %> includes the BOSH Director tile used to configure BOSH Director.

Example runtimes and services managed though <%= vars.ops_manager %> include, but are not limited to, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).

## <a id="responsibilities"></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> Responsibilities

<%= vars.ops_manager %> has one primary role and responsibility as the operator. The operator is responsible for installing and maintaining runtime and service tiles.

### <a id="operator"></a> Operator Responsibilities

The <%= vars.ops_manager %> operator is responsible for:

* Configuring <%= vars.platform_name %> capabilities

* Integrating <%= vars.platform_name %> with external systems

* Updating <%= vars.platform_name %> and installed products

* Monitoring <%= vars.platform_name %> health and performance

* Adjusting <%= vars.platform_name %> resources and options to fix health or performance issues

* Diagnosing and troubleshooting <%= vars.platform_name %> problems

* Managing <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) users, resources, and infrastructure

* Installing software services and otherwise enabling developers

* Creating and managing <%= vars.ops_manager %> user and client accounts


### <a id=""></a> Limited-Access Operator Responsibilities

Operators can give limited-access view or write <%= vars.ops_manager %> responsibilites to operators or others within an organization.

- **View-Only:** Users with view-only privileges can use <%= vars.ops_manager %> only to gather information.

- **Restricted Control:** Operators with restricted control cannot trigger a deployment and must request review from an operator with that access.

For more information about how to set privileges, see [Configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Ops Manager](./opsguide/config-rbac.html).

## <a id="ops-man-ui"></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI

The Ops Manager UI is a web application that you use to deploy and manage an <%= vars.platform_name %> PaaS deployment.
This is a guide to deploying and using Ops Manager.

## <a id='ops-man-api'></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> API

Use the Ops Manager API, `om` CLI, and Platform Automation Toolkit tasks to manage <%= vars.platform_name %> installations programmatically, from the command line, or from an automation pipeline.

See the [Using Ops Manager Programmatically and from the Command Line](./install/ops-man-api-cli.html) topic to learn how to get started using these Ops Manager tools.
