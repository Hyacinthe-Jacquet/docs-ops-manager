This topic provides an overview of how to install and configure <%= vars.platform_name %>.


## <a id='sequence'></a> <%= vars.platform_name %> Installation Sequence

<%= vars.platform_name %> is a suite of products that runs on multiple IaaSes. Planning and installing <%= vars.platform_name %> means building layers from the bottom up, starting with the details of your IaaS and ending with "Day 2" configurations that you perform on a installed and running <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

The typical <%= vars.platform_name %> planning and installation process is:

1. **Plan**
  - Review the requirements for your IaaS:
      - [AWS](./aws.html)
      - [Azure](./azure.html)
      - [GCP](./gcp.html)
      - [OpenStack](./openstack.html)
      - [vSphere](./vsphere.html)
  - See the Reference Architecture for your IaaS.
  - Assess your platform needs, including capacity, availability, container support, host OS, resource isolation, and geographical distribution. Discuss with your Pivotal contact.

1. **Deploy BOSH and Ops Manager**
  - [BOSH](https://bosh.io) is an open-source tool that lets you run software systems in the cloud.
      - BOSH and its IaaS-specific Cloud Provider Interfaces (CPIs) are what enable <%= vars.platform_name %> to run on multiple IaaSes.
      - See [Deploying with BOSH](#bosh) for a description of how BOSH deploys cloud software.
   - [<%= vars.ops_manager %>](../index.html) is a graphical dashboard that deploys with BOSH. <%= vars.ops_manager %> works with the BOSH Director to manage, configure, and upgrade products such as <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>), <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>), and services and partner products.
      - <%= vars.ops_manager %> represents products as _tiles_ with multiple configuration panes that let you input or select configuration values needed for the product.
      - <%= vars.ops_manager %> generates BOSH manifests containing the user-supplied configuration values, and sends them to the BOSH Director.
   - A single procedure deploys both BOSH and <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

1. (Optional) **Deploy IPsec BOSH Add-on**
  - [IPsec](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html) encrypts IP data to secure network traffic.
  - If IPsec is required for security compliance, deploy it before you install runtimes.
  - IPsec is deployed with BOSH rather than as an <%= vars.ops_manager %> tile.

1. **Install Runtimes**
  - [<%= vars.app_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/operating/configure-pas.html) (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) lets developers develop and manage cloud-native apps and software services.
      - <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> is based on the Cloud Foundry Foundation's open-source Application Runtime (formerly Elastic Runtime) project.
  - [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/index.html) (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) uses BOSH to run and manage Kubernetes container clusters.
      - <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> is based on the Cloud Foundry Foundation's open-source Container Runtime (formerly Kubo) project.
  - [<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/installing-pcf-is.html) lets a single <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment run apps from separate, isolated pools of computing, routing, and logging resources.
      - Operators replicate and configure an <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile for each new resource pool they want to create.
      - You must install <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> before you can install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>.
  - [<%= vars.windows_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service-windows/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/index.html) (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>) enables <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to manage Windows Server 2016 (1709) stemcells hosting .NET apps, and can also be replicated to create multiple isolated resource pools.
      - Operators replicate and configure a <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile for each new resource pool they want to create.
      - You must install <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> before you can install <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>.
  - [Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-7/operating/small-footprint.html) is an alternative to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> that uses far fewer VMs than <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> but has limitations.

1. **Day 2 Configurations**
  - Day 2 configurations set up internal operations and external integrations on a running <%= vars.platform_name %> platform.
      - Examples include front end configuration, user accounts, logging and monitoring, internal security, and container and stemcell images.

1. **Install Services**
  - Install software services for <%= vars.platform_name %> developers to use in their apps.
      - Services include the databases, caches, and message brokers that stateless cloud apps rely on to save information.
      - Installing and managing software services on <%= vars.platform_name %> is an ongoing process, and is covered in the [<%= vars.platform_name %> Operator Guide](../opsguide/index.html).


## <a id='bosh'></a> Deploying with BOSH

The following describes how you can use BOSH to run software in the cloud:

1. To use BOSH, you create a _manifest_ `.yml` file that specifies your software system's component processes, the VMs they run on, how they communicate, and anything else they need.

1. The BOSH command-line interface (CLI) or API sends the manifest to the _BOSH Director_, BOSH's executive process.

1. The BOSH Director provisions what it needs from the IaaS, _deploys_ your software to run in the cloud, and heals automatically when VMs go down.

1. BOSH CLI and API commands let you control BOSH-managed processes and allocate or release IaaS resources.
